# Voting Application

## Description

The Voting Application is a solution that allows users to add candidates and voters, and then select a candidate and a voter to cast a vote. The application focuses on ensuring data is dynamically updated in real-time, so every vote cast is immediately reflected in the user interface without needing to refresh the page.

## Features

- **Adding Candidates:** Users can add candidates, whose names are then displayed in a dropdown list. This feature is designed to allow quick and easy updates to the list of candidates.

- **Adding Voters:** Enables the introduction of new voters into the system. Each added voter appears in a corresponding dropdown list, making them immediately selectable for voting.

- **Casting Votes:** Users select a specific candidate and a voter from dropdown lists to cast a vote. The vote is registered in the system, resulting in the vote counter being updated and marking that the particular voter has voted.
